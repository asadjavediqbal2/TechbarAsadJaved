Introduction 

This document offers documentation for getALLShippingType
 API stands for Application Programming Interface which provides an interface between two systems. It’s like a cog that allows two systems to interact with each other. API allows two systems to interact programmatically through the API interface. APIs are often pulling and pushing data underneath user interfaces. Our API uses ‘HTTP/HTTPS’ protocol as the transport format for requests and responses that client making the request for the resource and the API server providing the response can use any programming language or platform.
We are using JSON objects for receiving responses from our API.  JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation which is a lightweight data-interchange format. It is a text format that is completely language independent but uses conventions that are familiar to programmers of the C-family of languages, including C, C++, C#, Java, JavaScript, Perl, Python, and many others. These properties make JSON an ideal data-interchange language.
a.	Base URL
 A base URL is, basically, the consistent part of any web address. For example, the url used throughout this module is https://dev.api.techbar.com . We'll note that the address section https://dev.api.techbar.com will always appears in the address bar and remains the same. This is our base URL. 
b.	Endpoint 
When an API interacts with another system, the touchpoints of this communication are considered endpoints. For APIs, an endpoint can include a URL of a server or service. Each endpoint is the location from which APIs can access the resources they need to carry out their function. There can be multiple endpoints for each API and each endpoint offers a unique functionality. 
c.	POST
POST is the HTTP method that is designed to send loads of data to a server from a specified resource. It usually transmits relatively small loads of data to a receiver. This method allows data to be sent as a package in a separate communication with the processing script. This means that data sent through the POST method will not be visible in the URL, as parameters are not sent along with the URL. The format of an HTTP POST should have HTTP headers, followed by a blank line, followed by the request body. POST requests can be used to submit a web form or upload a file, but it is critical to ensure that the receiving application resonates with the format being used. The Content-Type header indicates the type of body in the POST request. For example, in our case content type describes content as JSON and X-Auth header indicates the authentication via API Key.  

d.	Authorization  
All requests must be authenticated to have access to API. Authentication is done via HTTPS headers. The header will contain the API key that is used to authenticate the client.
